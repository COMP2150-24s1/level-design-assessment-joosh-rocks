## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)
Outline and justify how your level design facilitates the core player experience goals outlined in the assignment spec. Each section should be supported by specific examples and screenshots of your game encounters that highlight design choices made to facilitate that particular experience.

### 1.1. Discovery
What does the player learn? How does your encounter and broader level design facilitate learning in a way that follows good design practice?
The first section of the level presents easy tasks with little danger and plenty of checkpoints and health pickups to give opportunities for trial and error. In the first encounter with an enemy, a chomper is on an elevated platform so the player doesn't have to crouch to shoot it (IMG1). In the first encounter with an obstacle, hitting the obstacle will bounce the player into a health pickup, as to allow the player to figure out what it is in a safe environment. The encounters in the first section get gradually more complicated, with multiple features being combined in one encounter, but it doesn't get too difficult before the second section. All components used in the level are demonstrated in the first section in an easy and comfortable environment. This allows more complicated or difficult encounters later on to be less frustrating because the mechanics are already known, leading to a more seamless and enjoyable experience.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 
Checkpoints and health pickups relieve the player of the tension created by drawn-out and difficult encounters. Large, wide platforms also provide a sense of relief, while 1-tile-wide platforms can add to the difficulty and drama. The first section has mostly wide, safe gaps between encounters, while the second and especially the third section have thinner and smaller gaps, with more flow from encounter to encounter, one example in section 3 even has a checkpoint and a health pickup on the same tile to make the "rest" shorter. Relief is provided intermittently, with a gradual decrease in the number of rest areas, to provide an enjoyable dramatic arc.

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?
The main challenges include: jumping over large gaps, killing enemies, jumping over obstacles, timing jumps onto moving platforms, not taking too much damage, finding checkpoints and health pickups, etc. These challenges are supplied individually in the first section and combined more in the second and third sections. More difficult challenges are more often followed by health pickups or checkpoints compared to easier encounters (excluding the first section where nearly all challenges are followed and/or prefaced by health pickups and checkpoints, regardless of difficulty.) Checkpoints are not too sparse that it's overly frustrating to respawn, but also not too frequent that respawning isn't an inconvenience at all. The same goes for health pickups and taking damage. Because of this, it's quite easy to be persistent with challenges rather than give up or become annoyed.

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?
Many spaces are open and allow the player to go any way they want, while many others are constricted or with only one available direction (IMG2). Most of the level has only one direction that the player can go to get to the finish, but for much of it, multiple directions are available without detriment to the player. Some encounters are skippable, for example, some enemies do not need to be killed to progress without harm, while others will inflict a lot of damage if not killed before attempting to go past. Other encounters are completely unskippable, for example, there is a door that must be opened to progress, but to open it, the player must perform a few jumps between platforms, flick a switch, them come back across the same platforms back to where they were before. (IMG3)

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Weapon Pickup (Gun)
I wanted to start the level off with a weapon, so enemies could be integrated into the level from the beginning

### 2.2. Chompers
After picking up the gun, it is used immediately, as to not have too many things going on at once.

### 2.3. Checkpoints
After the first encounter, a checkpoint in reached, as to not have to repeat it if you die on a later challenge

### 2.4. Health Pickups
A health pickup allows you to go into the next encounter on full health if you were hit by the chomper

### 2.5. Spikes
The next obstacle could have been anything, but I chose spikes to keep it simple for the start

### 2.6. Acid
In the same vain as the spikes, simplicity was key

### 2.7. Spitters
After two physical obstacles, I decided to introduce a spitter in the same way the chomper was earlier

### 2.8. Passable Platform
I used a passable platform to create a vertical aspect to the level, and keep things interesting.

### 2.9. Keys
A detour of a few short jumps claims the first key, in an easy fashion but introducing the concept of detouring to get keys for later in the level

### 2.10. Moving Platform
A moving platform over a small acid pool introduces the idea without being easy to miss, as it is always in sight of the player from the safe platform after the previous encounter.

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)
Concepts involving the staff introduced after all other mechanics to avoid complications or confusion

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.
